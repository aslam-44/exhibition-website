        <h1>Science</h1>
        <p>It’s not always obvious that science has an impact on our everyday lives, but the truth is that science impacts the many decisions we make every day. From taking care of our health and well-being and deciding to buy paper or plastic in the grocery store or even answering a child’s question who asks what the reason for blue skies is, science plays a significant role throughout our day. Science education aims to increase people's understanding of science and the construction of knowledge as well as to promote scientific literacy and responsible citizenship. We can use science communication to increase science-related knowledge among adults, in particular. At an introductory level, science is interaction with other people that teaches patience and perseverance.
            It can also help children develop a healthy dose of sceptical thinking, educate children on how to think about their surroundings, and makes them aware that they can help in solving the world’s issues</p>
