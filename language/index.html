        <h1>Language</h1>
        <p>The language is always believed to play a central role in learning. No matter what the subject area, students assimilate new concepts when they listen, talk, read and write about what they  are learning. Speaking and writing reflects the thinking process that is taking place. Studentslearn in language, therefore if their language is weak, so is their learning. In the context of teaching foreign and second languages we are used to consider language as a medium for everyday and often fairly trivial communicative activities. We are also well aware of its function for retrieving information from all sorts of verbal sources. However, in thecontext of teaching and learning content in subject areas such as Mathematics, History, Social Sciences, Physics and even Art and Music there are more reasons why language matters. Language helps students to learn the content more. It helps learners to expand their ideas. It helps learners to discuss different issues in a foreign language. It helps learners to collect different technical terms related to different subjects.</p>
